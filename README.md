This repository contains two Python applications.

1. **guess_number.py** - a small guessing game. The program picks a random number between 1 and 20 and prompts the user to guess until the correct number is entered.

   Run it with:
   ```bash
   python guess_number.py
   ```

2. **ocr_app.py** - a minimal UI to extract text from an image using OCR. It opens a window where you can select an image file. Any text detected in the image is shown in the window. Required libraries `pytesseract` and `Pillow` must be installed for the application to work.

   Run it with:
   ```bash
   python ocr_app.py
   ```
